Three birds are on a tree.

They're a bit bored so they decide to write a story.

Mummy bird says you and dad are good at different things but when it comes to organising we all know I'm the chief so I tell you what I'll do. I'll create a shape for the story and you can then both have a copy.

Mum then took three pieces of paper. On all three she gave the story a title: "Life on the tree"

She folded them all into three sections and wrote:

Beginning 

Once upon a time there were three birds who were bored.
They decided to write a story

Middle

Suddenly aliens landed on the tree and decided to take them to a space ship.

End

They worked out the problem

She gave dad and baby bird the copies and kept the third.

She said, I'll add the elements you create to our main story.

Baby bird you concentrate on what happens in the middle and let dad know your ideas and Dad you work on the end and how they resolve this.
Once you've written your parts we'll put them all together in my copy and see what we end up with.

Baby took the story told Dad that alien's would land and edited the middle.
